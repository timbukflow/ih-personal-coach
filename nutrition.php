          <h2>Protein</h2>
          <p>
          Protein helps our body to build muscles and strengthen our immune system. They consist of long chains of 22 different amino acids. Our body needs all of them to function properly. Proteins build new tissue and repair damaged cells in our body. They also help forming hormones and enzymes which play variety of roles such as metabolism and sexual development. <br> <br> 
          There are many different types of protein that play important roles in our body. Collagen for example gives strength elasticity and composition to our hair and skin. Examples of healthy protein sources are lentils, low-fat dairy products, tofu, nuts, seeds, peas or tempeh. Some common foods such as whole grain bread, potatoes, corn or pasta also contain protein. Soya protein is the most essential and strong protein – equal to any protein of animal origin.

          <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
          <p>
          Carbohydrates give us power. Good examples of carbohydrates are bread, potatoes, pasta, soda, chips, candies/sweets, cookies/biscuits, pudding, cake, sugar or bananas. They are an ideal source of energy because carbohydrates convert readily into glucose, which helps our body to supply the energy to form cellular constituents. Carbohydrates are made up of three compounds Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen formed by plants. Four types of carbohydrates are important: Sugar, Starch, Fiber and Gum – both in complex and simple forms. Unlike other food groups, they don’t cause weight gain if taken regularly and in the right amounts. A lack of carbohydrates can cause the production of ketones in the body resulting in a condition known as ketosis.

          <h2>Fat</h2>
          <p>
          Fat provides us with extra energy. As a nutrient, a certain amount of fat is vital for our body. It doesn't necessarily make us fat. Fat insulates our bodies, protecting our vital organs from sudden changes in temperature. It is also important for a healthy skin and regulates blood pressure. Fats consists of a wide group of compounds, soluble in organic matter and insoluble in water. They provide nine calories per gram. When dietary fat is digested, different types of fatty acids are produced – each of them design to a specific purpose.

          <h2>Vitamins</h2>
          <p>
          Vitamins are organic compounds, which regulate our bodies processes and play an important role in making it function properly.

          <h2>Water</h2>
          <p>
            Water shapes our cells and acts as a medium where body processes can occur. It is the most important nutrient our body needs, making uo 70 percent of our total mass. Water helps to dissolve and carry the essential nutrients to all parts of the body. It is also needed to help maintain the body temperature and helps to carry away the body's waste products.
