        <h2 class="pagesubtitle">Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          To build an effective individual training plan for each client, I need to know their current physical condition. I use various methods of analysis, including the measurement of body parameters such as joint mobility or blood composition as well as assessing the state of your musculoskeletal system along with your previous experience. This comprehensive and detailed analysis allows me to determine your goals more accurately and optimize the ways to achieve them.

        <h2 class="pagesubtitle">Correction</h2>
        <p>
          In my analysis, I pay special attention to possible muscular imbalance, curvature of the spine or aberrance in the optimal pattern of movement. Subsequently I develop a system of exercises to create the correct symmetrical function of your musculoskeletal system. We will then work on strengthening muscles for deep core stabilization. This will set a stable foundation for building a beautifully proportioned figure.
