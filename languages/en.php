Training with coaches of European and World champions, I acquired a meaningful approach towards sports activities, perception of the body and maintaining health. Over the course of my twenty-year coaching career, I have gained lots of personal experience, following new trends, introducing new classes as well as studying new achievements in medicine and science. As a European vice-champion, I am also well aware of a balanced nutrition and its importance for health and achieving goals.

Even people with limited mobility can do senior gymnastics and certain fitness exercises for seniors. Already from the age of 25, the muscles regress naturally, which is why older people have considerable mobility restrictions in certain movement sequences. With little exercise, you also quickly become sluggish and tired, which in turn causes the metabolism to slow down. In order to remain mobile, seniors can fall back on numerous walking aids. But a lot can be done to keep the body and mind fit even in old age. In addition to a healthy diet, gentle sports such as cycling or yoga, but also everyday activities such as climbing stairs or gardening help to stay healthy. Of course, it is not about you having to run a marathon or lift heavy dumbbells – rather, senior gymnastics should make sure that the movements are carried out slowly and fluently.",
