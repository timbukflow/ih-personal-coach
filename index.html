          <h2>Protein</h2>
          <p>
            Protein helps our body to build muscles and strong immune system. Basically proteins are made up of long chains of amino acids. There are 22 different types of amino acid and our body needs all these amino acid to function properly. Protein is abundant type of nutrient in our body that builds new tissues and repairs all damaged cells in our body. It also helps in formation of hormones and enzymes which play variety of roles in our body such as metabolism and sexual development. There are many types of protein that play different types of important role in our body. For example collagen is a protein and it gives the strength, elasticity and composition of our hair and skin. Some of the good protein sources are lentils, low-fat dairy products, tofu, nuts, seeds, peas, tempeh. Some common foods such as whole grain bread, potatoes, corn and pasta also have protein. Soya protein is the most essential and strong protein and it is equal to any animal origin protein.

          <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
          <p>
            Carbohydrates give us energy. This is an ideal source of energy for the body because carbohydrates converted more readily into glucose. It helps our body to supply the energy for the formation of cellular constituent. Carbohydrates are made up of three compounds Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen formed by plants. There are four types of carbohydrates are important - Sugar, Starches, Fiber and Gum. If carbohydrates taken regularly it doesn't cause any weight gain, unless like other food group. There are two types of carbohydrates - Complex and Simple. Efficiency of carbohydrates can cause the production of ketones in the body, it can results into a condition known as ketosis. The good examples of carbohydrates are breads, potatoes, pasta, soda, chips, candies/sweets, cookies/biscuits, puddings, cakes, sugar, bananas etc.

          <h2>Fat</h2>
          <p>
            Fat provides us extra energy. It is a nutrient and a particular amount of fat is necessary for our body. It doesn't always make us fat. It play role to insulate our bodies by giving us protection from sudden changes in temperature and also protects our vital organs. Fats consists of a wide group of compounds are soluble in organic solvents and insoluble in water. Fats provide 9 calories per gram. When dietary fat is digested, fatty acids are produced. It is also important for healthy skin and blood pressure regulation.
            <br><br>
            There are two types of fats Saturated (solid at room temperature) and Unsaturated (liquid at room temperature). To obtain an adequate amount of linoleic acid, one of the few fatty acids the body cannot produce on itself. Any adult needs one tablespoon of unsaturated fat daily. Saturated fats mainly occur in dairy products like butter, cream, cheese and some chocolates. The source of unsaturated fats are soybean, sunflower and corn oils.

        <div class="supinfo right" id="supinfo04">
          <h2>Vitamins</h2>
          <p>
            A vitamin is an organic compound, it regulate our body processes and plays an important role to make our body function properly. The term vitamin was derived from 'vitamine', a combination word from Vital and Amine. Today a chemical compound is called a vitamin. Our body needs vitamins as substances to grow and develop normally. There are 13 vitamins necessary for our body. Some of them are A, B, C, D, E, K, vitamin B-6 and vitamin B-12. In our daily life we get all most all these vitamins form foods whatever we take. Our body can also produce vitamins D and K.
            <br><br>
            Each vitamin plays specific jobs. Any particular low levels of vitamins cause deficiency disease. For example, if we don't get enough vitamin D it can cause rickets. Deficiency of vitamin 'A' can cause Night Blindness.
            <br><br>
            If we eat a balanced diet we get enough essential vitamin automatically form our daily food or liquid. We don't even need to take any particular vitamin separately. Only in some cases we need to take a daily multivitamin for optimal health.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="supinfo right" id="supinfo05">
          <h2>Minerals</h2>
          <p>
            Minerals regulate our body processes and also make body tissues. Minerals make our body work properly same as vitamin play the role but it doesn't prevent weight loss. Although we get it form our daily foods, so we don't need to take it separately. Minerals boost our immune system.

These types of minerals can be found from our daily food or liquid supplement like salt, soy sauce, milk, vegetable oils, whole grains, cheese, nuts etc

            <h2>The beginning</h2>
            <p>
              My start point is Königsberg . At the age of four, my parents took me to gymnastics in order to improve my posture, but after 5 years I took part in international tournaments , and at 16 I became a master of sports . While studying at the university , majoring in "medical and biological disciplines", I began to engage in professional fitness , with coaches who trained European and World champions , where I acquired a more meaningful approach to sports activities, attitude to the body and maintaining health.
            </p>
            <h2>The engagement</h2>
            <p>
              Over the course of my twenty-year coaching career, I have gained my own experience, following new trends, introducing new classes , studying new achievements in medicine and science . As a vice-champion of Europe, I am also well aware of nutrition , and how its important for health and achieving goals.
              I through my solid education and my great experience in the fitness industry, I had the opportunity to work with various celebrities. I was a vip fitness coach for years. I was able to develop even deeper into my material and was able to acquire a well-founded basis knowledge.

              Das Training findet individuell und nach ihren Bedürfnissen statt. In der morgendämmerung Laufen im Park, das sonntägliche mobilitätstraining in Ihrem Wohnzimmer, schmerzlindernde Rückenübungen im Fitnessstudio. Der Ort und Zeitraum wird ganz auf Ihren Lebensrytmus angepasst um das Training harmonisch in Ihren Tag einfliessen zu lassen.

            <p class="negativfont">
              Das Online-Training ist auf dem gleichen Fundament aufgebaut wie das Personal Training mit dem unterschied das es ortsunabhängig von Ihrem Coach stattfinden kann, ob sie sich gerade auf ihrer Yacht im Mittelmeer befinden, auf Geschäftsreise in New York oder Ihr Wohnort in Dubai ist, die Begleitung ihrer Transformation findet keinen unterbruch oder Qualitätsminderung.

                With the development of digital technologies and the automation of many processes, people's motor activity has decreased. This negatively affects the health, development, and functioning of all organs and systems in both adults and children. Joint training will help to cope with the problem. After all, the example of parents is the most effective way to generate a child's desire to play sports. In addition, physical activity, practiced by the whole family, helps to establish, and strengthen relations between spouses, parents and children.
