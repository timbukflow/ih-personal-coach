          <p>
          Growing up in Königsberg, my parents took me to gymnastics classes at the age of four in order to improve my posture. Five years later, I took part in international tournaments and at 16 I became a master of sports. While majoring in medical and biological disciplines at University, I began to engage in professional fitness. Training with coaches of European and World champions, I acquired a meaningful approach towards sports activities, perception of the body and maintaining health. Over the course of my twenty-year coaching career, I have gained lots of personal experience, following new trends, introducing new classes as well as studying new achievements in medicine and science. As a European vice-champion, I am also well aware of a balanced nutrition and its importance for health and achieving goals. Through my solid education and great experience in the fitness industry, I had the opportunity to work with various celebrities. During my years as a fitness coach for VIPs, I developed an even deeper understanding of the human body and acquired a well-founded knowledge base.

              With the development of digital technologies and the automation of many processes, people's motor activity has decreased. This negatively affects the health, development and function of all organs and systems in both adults and children. Joint training will help to cope with the problem. After all, the example of parents is the most effective way to develop a child's desire to play sports. In addition, physical activity, practiced by the whole family, helps to establish and strengthen relations between spouses, parents and children.

              All parents want their children to be active, healthy and happy. In addition, all parents know that physical activity is essential for the development of the child's body. At the same time, it is not necessary to send the child to different types of training. Active teaching at home will not bring less benefit. Simple elements will undoubtedly please the child, they will develop not only his muscle strength, but also his dexterity, flexibility, coordination of movements and even intelligence.

            During personal training, the trainer tirelessly monitors the execution of exercises, checks technique and calculates rest periods to reduce the risk of injury and increase efficiency. The trainer will also distribute the load depending on your health condition at the time of training. You will receive an individual training plan and additional motivation that will allow you to achieve success in a short time.

              Why is senior gymnastics important? Anyone who thinks that they can no longer do anything for their body at an advanced age is wrong. Even people with limited mobility can do senior gymnastics and certain fitness exercises for seniors. Already from the age of 25, the muscles regress naturally, which is why older people have considerable mobility restrictions in certain movement sequences. With little exercise, you also quickly become sluggish and tired, which in turn causes the metabolism to slow down. In order to remain mobile, seniors can fall back on numerous walking aids. But a lot can be done to keep the body and mind fit even in old age. In addition to a healthy diet, gentle sports such as cycling or yoga, but also everyday activities such as climbing stairs or gardening help to stay healthy. Of course, it is not about you having to run a marathon or lift heavy dumbbells – rather, senior gymnastics should make sure that the movements are carried out slowly and fluently.
